# Exercise to leave the **Field**

It's finally time for us to leave the **Field** and start climbing the **Hill**.

## The Result

You can [here](https://igordespi.github.io/End-of-the-Field/) find the result of my work 

## Purpose of the exercise

### Day one: The collection:

We had to find 10 items to form a collection (books,videogames, movies, music, paintings).  
We had to find different informations about each item of our list (pic, link, category, description and author).

### Day Two: Building the website:

On the second day we had to build the website of our project.  
I used the framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to help myself to build the structure of my website.  
I added also a little bit of personal *CSS* to fix some things.
