                    It is a real-time strategy video game. It is a derivative of the Age of Empires series, from which
                    it
                    takes many gameplay elements.
                    Everything happens in a universe inspired by mythology (Greek/Roman, Nordic and Egyptian). There is
                    a
                    campaign mode where the goal is to complete the game's scenario missions.
                    There is also a map creator mode and a multiplayer mode where the goal is to develop one's
                    civilisation
                    faster than that of one's opponents in order to annihilate them.

                    The Binding of Isaac is a rogue-like 2D action-adventure game seen from above. The player plays as
                    Isaac, or one of the six other playable characters, and must explore a series of dungeons with
                    rectangular rooms, which will sometimes be locked with mechanisms or locks, or sometimes camouflaged
                    by
                    a wall, requiring a bomb to get through. The characters embodied by the player fight by throwing
                    their
                    tears in the four directions of space: up, down, left and right. Many objects can change the way the
                    tears behave while changing the character's appearance.

                    Fortnite is a sandbox oriented Tower-Defense. Players meet as a team and have to crafted weapons and
                    traps, then build a fortress and defend it against the many monsters that will come to attack it.
                    This part of the game is the survival part of the game. There is another game mode which is the
                    Battle Royale. 100 players find themselves on the same map with the aim of killing each other until
                    there is only one player left alive and he is declared the winner. The card gets smaller and smaller
                    as time goes by. There have been several seasons in the game, each of which has brought new features
                    to the game.
